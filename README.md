Problem Statement No.31 – Smart Home Energy Advisor Agent

The Challenge:
A Smart Home Energy Advisor Agent acts like your personal electricity manager. It takes information from your smart meter and appliances, analyzes power usage, and gives you tips to save energy. The agent can answer questions like "Why is my bill so high this month?" or "What time should I run the washing machine to save money?". It uses AI to understand consumption patterns and provide simple recommendations.

Technology – Use of IBM Cloud Lite services and IBM Granite AI model is mandatory.
